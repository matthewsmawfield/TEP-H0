The Hubble tension—the persistent ~5-sigma discrepancy between local distance-ladder measurements (H0 ~ 73 km/s/Mpc) and early-universe CMB inference (H0 = 67.4 +/- 0.5 km/s/Mpc)—may reflect residual systematics in the calibration of Cepheid distances. This study tests an environment-dependent bias motivated by the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP): periodic phenomena used as clocks can acquire a host-dependent shift correlated with gravitational potential depth.

Using the SH0ES Cepheid host sample (N=29) and Pantheon+ Hubble-diagram redshifts, the relationship between derived host-level H0 values and host central velocity dispersion sigma (a TEP-independent kinematic proxy for potential depth) is examined. A statistically significant correlation is found (Spearman rho = 0.434, p = 0.019; Pearson r = 0.428, p = 0.021). Propagating the full SH0ES GLS distance-modulus covariance into a non-diagonal covariance for the H0 vector, a correlated-null Monte Carlo test yields p_cov = 0.026 (Spearman) and p_cov = 0.039 (Pearson), with an effective sample size N_eff ~ 7.5. A median split at sigma_med ~ 90 km/s gives H0 = 67.82 +/- 1.62 km/s/Mpc (low-sigma; N=15) versus 72.45 +/- 2.32 km/s/Mpc (high-sigma; N=14), implying Delta H0 = 4.63 km/s/Mpc.

A TEP-motivated conformal correction of the form mu_corr = mu_obs + alpha * log10(sigma/sigma_ref) is then applied, with sigma_ref = 75.25 km/s defined a priori by the SH0ES anchor weighting. Optimizing alpha to remove the residual H0–sigma slope yields alpha = 0.58 +/- 0.16 and a unified local estimate H0 = 68.66 +/- 1.51 km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a Planck tension of 0.79 sigma. Train/test splits and leave-one-out cross validation show the coupling is stable and that the corrected sample exhibits negligible residual H0–sigma dependence out of sample.

As a complementary, within-galaxy test, an HST differential analysis of Cepheids in M31 yields an "Inner Fainter" offset Delta W = +0.68 +/- 0.19 mag (3.6 sigma), consistent with a density-gated screening transition in the bulge/core relative to the outer disk. The anchor–host mismatch (independent P-L fits to extragalactic geometric anchors yield a near-zero anchor-level coupling, alpha_anchor ~ 0.03, in tension with the host-level coupling) finds a natural resolution in group halo screening: all three anchors (LMC, NGC 4258, M31) are members of galaxy groups, embedding them in deep ambient potentials that trigger chameleon-type screening regardless of internal disk densities. The SN Ia hosts, selected for smooth Hubble flow, are biased toward isolated field galaxies that lack this external screening. This framework generates a falsifiable prediction: the TEP distance-ladder bias should be unique to isolated field galaxies and suppressed in group/cluster environments.
