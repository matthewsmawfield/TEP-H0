[10:40:17] [INFO] COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS CONCLUSION
[10:40:17] [INFO] ============================================================
[10:40:17] [SUCCESS] ✓ Cepheids show significant H0-σ correlation
[10:40:17] [INFO] • TRGB does not show significant H0-σ correlation
[10:40:17] [INFO] 
[10:40:17] [INFO]   INTERPRETATION:
[10:40:17] [INFO]   ───────────────
[10:40:17] [INFO]   This pattern is consistent with TWO superimposed effects:
[10:40:17] [INFO] 
[10:40:17] [INFO]   1. COMMON EFFECT (can affect multiple indicators):
[10:40:17] [INFO]      → Peculiar velocities correlate with host mass/σ
[10:40:17] [INFO]      → Can induce baseline H0-σ structure in multiple indicators
[10:40:17] [INFO] 
[10:40:17] [INFO]   2. CEPHEID-SPECIFIC EFFECT (TEP):
[10:40:17] [INFO]      → Period contraction in high-σ environments
[10:40:17] [INFO]      → Isolated by DIFFERENTIAL test: Δμ = μ_TRGB - μ_Ceph
