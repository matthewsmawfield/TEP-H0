    <meta name="description" content="The Hubble Tension—the persistent 5σ discrepancy between local distance-ladder measurements ($H_0 \approx 73$ km/s/Mpc) and early-universe CMB inference ($H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc)—represents a significant challenge in precision cosmology. This study proposes that the tension arises from a systematic, environment-dependent bias in Cepheid-based distances, as predicted by the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP). TEP posits that proper time accumulation depends on the local gravitational potential. Cepheid variable stars, acting as &quot;standard clocks&quot; via their period-luminosity relation, experience differential time flow governed by their host galaxy environment. Consistent with the anomalous spin-down rates observed in globular cluster pulsars (Paper 11), Cepheids in deep gravitational potentials (high velocity dispersion $\sigma$) experience period contraction relative to calibration environments. When interpreted through a universal P-L relation, this period deficit masquerades as diminished luminosity, causing systematic underestimation of distances to SN Ia host galaxies and consequent overestimation of $H_0$. Analysis of the SH0ES Cepheid sample ($N=29$), stratified by host galaxy velocity dispersion (a TEP-independent kinematic observable), reveals a statistically significant correlation between host potential depth and derived $H_0$ (Spearman $\rho = 0.434$, $p = 0.019$; Pearson $r = 0.428$, $p = 0.021$). A median-split stratification at $\sigma_{\rm med} \approx 90$ km/s yields $H_0 = 67.82 \pm 1.62$ km/s/Mpc (low-$\sigma$; $N=15$) versus $72.45 \pm 2.32$ km/s/Mpc (high-$\sigma$; $N=14$), implying $\Delta H_0 = 4.63$ km/s/Mpc. Because published $\sigma$ values are heterogeneous (direct stellar absorption and calibrated HI/rotation proxies), we treat measurement methodology as a first-class provenance variable and report covariance-aware significance tests using the full SH0ES GLS distance-modulus covariance. Application of the TEP conformal correction with an optimized coupling $\alpha = 0.58 \pm 0.16$ and effective calibrator reference $\sigma_{\rm ref} = 75.25$ km/s yields a unified local Hubble constant of $H_0 = 68.66 \pm 1.51$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a Planck tension of $0.79\sigma$. Out-of-sample validation (train/test splits and LOOCV) shows that the optimized coupling is stable and removes the residual environmental trend in held-out hosts. A differential analysis within M31 yields an “Inner Fainter” signal in HST photometry. This result, initially counter-intuitive, is resolved by the theory&#39;s density-dependent screening mechanism: the high-density M31 bulge ($\rho > \rho_{\rm trans}$) is screened (restoring standard physics), while the lower-density SN Ia host disks remain unscreened. The M31 signal thus marks the empirical crossing of the screening threshold. *Keywords:* Hubble tension – Cepheid variables – distance ladder – velocity dispersion – temporal equivalence principle – gravitational time dilation">
